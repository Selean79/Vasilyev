Heapar Small Report
Sometimes we need to make formatted output (report like result). In this 
case we can use WebBrowser control and render HTML pages or use Richtext 
control. The  both  methods  may  be  suitable, but data controlling and 
flexible  is  very  bad. Heapar Essential Library includes a new control 
SmallReportRenderer. It allows you to build small but flexible  reports. 
You fully control the data and can format text and tables as you wish.
